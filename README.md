## Problem Title

SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

## Problem Description

Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

The proposed solution is a web-based AI-driven interview simulation software that replicates a real-life boardroom interview experience. The system will:

* Automate the interview process using AI-driven dynamic questioning.

* Evaluate both interviewers and candidates based on relevancy and scoring mechanisms.

* Ensure an unbiased, standardized assessment process using NLP & ML models.

* Provide a virtual interview boardroom experience with real-time feedback.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram


## Use Cases

### 1. Candidate Registration & Profile Setup

Candidates sign up and fill in expertise areas.

AI recommends probable questions based on the profile.

### 2. AI-driven Interview Simulation

Virtual Boardroom experience using AI-generated dynamic questioning.

Ice-breaking questions followed by technical and managerial queries.

### 3. Real-time Scoring & Evaluation

NLP & AI models assess the relevancy of candidate responses.

Interviewerâ€™s question relevancy is also evaluated.

Final score calculation based on multiple factors (technical, managerial, communication skills).

### 4. Interviewer Panel & Reporting

Live scoring dashboard for interviewers.

Interviewer performance analytics.

Final candidate ranking & report generation.

### 5. System Administration & Security

Role-based access control (RBAC) for users.

Logging & monitoring of interviews.

Compliance with data security standards.
